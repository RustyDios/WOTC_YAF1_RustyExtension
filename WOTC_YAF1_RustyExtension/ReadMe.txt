[h1]What is this?[/h1]
This mod is an extension for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=934236622] RoboJumpers Yet Another F1 [/url] that provides some custom colour profiles for more unit types/groups.

[h1]That is so cool! ... Tell me more [/h1]
I know right ?!
This is all possible thanks to the Event Hooks that [b]RoboJumper[/b] had nicely put in YAF1, allowing mod authors and users to do make custom profiles. Which, despite using the mod for years, was not a functionality I knew it had!

In the screenshots above the 'standard' XCOM, ADVENT, Lost and Ruler Profiles are from Robojumper and uploaded for comparison, but I have added profiles for;[list]
[*]The Chosen
[*]Templars
[*]Reapers
[*]Skirmishers
[*]SPARKS and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1452700934] MEC Troopers [/url]
[*]'Psionics Classes'
[*]'CHL Faction Teams'
[*]MOCX
[*]THE HIVE
[*]Children of the King
[*]Non-Units
[/list]
Some of these use simple config by character group or ability. But some of the more advanced ones are done by event listener (like HIVE, MOCX, Faction Teams and Psionics)

The 'non-units' screen happens if you use the tab/shift keys to cycle units, whilst viewing the YAF1 screen. YAF1 cannot normally open from directly targeted destructables. 

I also add a small LOOT indication to the enemy info line if they are carrying loot!

[h1]Config Options[/h1]
The list of 'Psionic' valid classes is editable in the [b]XComGame.ini[/b] but by default is set to base game [b]Psi-Operatives[/b], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2360051437] My Psionic [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138411890] ADVENT AVENGERS Psionics Class [/url].

If anyone has classes they wish for me to add to the list by default, please let me know, preferably with a modlink or direct internal class template name.

The loot information can be turned off in the [b]XComGame.ini[/b], as well as if you want it to require Scanning/Target Definition.

If anyone has 'group profile' suggestions please let me know and I will consider making one.

[h1]Credits and Thanks[/h1]
Obvious HUGE thanks to [b]RoboJumper[/b] for the base mod this adds onto. 
A part of my xcom2 modlist for countless years!

Many thanks to the people of the xcom2 modders discord for continuous help and support!!
